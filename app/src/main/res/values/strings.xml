        Game rules: on a display, there will be three figures, two below and one above, two of them
        will contain numbers. It is necessary that the sum of the numbers from the bottom two shapes
        will be equal to the number from the top shape, for this you need to choose the missing
        number.\n\nFor example: there are number 7 in the top circle, question mark in one of the
        bottom shapes and number 4 in another. It means that there must be number 3 instead of
        the question mark, because 3+4 = 7
